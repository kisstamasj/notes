- **Tools:** Use the Azure Portal to manage large numbers of VMs and even hybrid clouds.
- **Compliance:** Use Azure blueprints to make your VMs comply with a company guidlines
- **Recommendations:** Azure will recommend improvements to ensure better scurity, higher availability and greater performance.
- **Choice:**: Choose amount of RAM, number of CPUs, Windows or Linux
- There are new virtual machines with dedicated GPUs for artificatl inteligence and deep learning scenarios.

### Pricing
- Calculated hourly
- Depends on the amount of resources

### Use Cases
- **Pros**:
  - **Control**: Use virtual machines when you need to control all aspects of an environment or machine.
  - **Application**: Install specific applications on your Windows or Linux machines
  - **Existing infrastructure**: You can move existing resources and virtual machines to Azure from on-premises or another cloud provider.
- **Cons**:
  - **Not for everything**: If you can use another Azure service instead, it is often worth it.
  -  **Maintenance**: A lot of maintenance with VMs. Operating system updates, patches, security concerns.
  
### Exam tips
Virtual Machines are at the core of Azure compute and are widely used.
- A virtual machine is your machine exclusivly.
- You don't buy, own or control any hardware. Azure does this.
- Virtual machines are an IaaS offering, where you are responsible for the entire machine.
- Azure virtual machines take advantage of Azure tools.
- Pricing goes up as resources go up, and you pay by the hour.

### Creating VM
It can be created like a resource, or directly we can choose the Virtual Machine Azure Service.
