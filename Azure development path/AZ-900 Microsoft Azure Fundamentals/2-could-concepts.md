# Cloud concepts

## The Language of Cloud Computing

### High availability
- Core to the cloud
- you don't own the hardware
- add more servers with a click
- If hardware fails, replace it instantly
- Use clusters to ensure high availability

### Reliability

> a.k.a Fault Tolearance/Disaster recovery

- Resilience: The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- Deploy in multiple locations:
  - Global-scale computing
  - Protects agains regional failures/disaster
- No single point of failure
  - Resource in multiple locations
  - If one computer goes down, others pick up the load

### Scalability
Scalability is the process of adding more resource on an as-needed basis.
- Scaling Out (Horizontal scaling)
  - Incrase instace count of existing resources
  - Incrasing the servers number to handle more request
  - Non-disruptive
- Scaling Up (Vertical scaling)
  - Incrase instace size of existing resource
  - Get a bigger server: more CPU, RAM etc..
  - Disruptive
- Scaling down
  - Decrase instace size of existing resource

### Predicatability
Predictable performance and costs

- Performance
  - Consistent experience for customers regardless of traffic
  - Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability provide a consistence experience
- Costs
  - No unexpected surprises
  - Track and forecast resource usage (costs) in real time
  - Analytics provide patterns/trends to optimize usage

### Security
Full control of the security of your cloud environment. Patches, maintenance, network control, and more.

### Governance
Is standardizing cloud deployments to meet requirements/compony standards
- Standardized environments
- regulatory requirements
- audit for compliance

### Manageability
- Management of the cloud:
  - Autoscaling
  - Monitoring
  - Templage-based deployments
- Management in the cloud
  - Portal
  - CLI
  - APIs

## The Language of Cloud Ecomomics

### Capital and Operational Expenditure

#### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- Money spent by a business or organisation on acquiring or maintaining fixed, such as land, builings, and equipment.
- Ex: Buying more servers
- Large upfront investment.

#### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- An ongoing cost of running a product,  buisness, or system on a day-to-day basis, including annual costs
- Ex: The power that could be the power to run the server.
- Pay-as-you-go

### Cloud pricing models
