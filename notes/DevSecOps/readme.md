# GitLab with Git Essentials

## GitLab Overview

GitLab brings the complete DevSecOps lifecycle into a single comprehensive platform. It includes everything from Source Code Management, CI/CD, Integrated Security, and much more to meet all of your development requirements.

The SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is complex. And as your organization's SDLC matures, your toolchain complexity increases to support each stage of the SDLC. Historically, as needs evolve, organizations will identify one preferred tool for each function leading to a system of disparate tools typically held together with "digital duct tape" and manual processes Which often lead to:
- Redundant and incompatible tools
- Data and process silos
- No alignment among teams
- No consistent application security or compliance
- No consistent traceability
- A high degree of context switching
