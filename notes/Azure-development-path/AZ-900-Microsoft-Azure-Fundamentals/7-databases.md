# Databases

## Cosmos DB

### Syncronization

- **Easy with Cosmos**: Traditional databases that weren't cloud enabled could be very difficult to set up across multiple regions.  Azure takes care of all of it with Cosmos.
- **One Click to add regions: **: It is very easy to expand to more regions with Cosmos DB and have the data stay in sinc.
- **Continued Syncronization**: Cosmos DB stays on top of all reads and writes to your data and makes sure data is moved between regions to stay in sync.

### Scalability

- **Automated**: Comsos DB automatically scales to meet resource demand.
- **Infinite Resources**: Any number of users of your application can be supported.
- **Lowest Price**: Even though the scaling is automatic, you only pay for the resources you use.

### Connectivity

- **Developer**: Choose from various software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs).
- **Languages**: A language for most developers, including C#, Java and Node.JS
- **Platforms**: Choose from lots of data platforms to integrate with, including SQL, MongoDB and Cassandra.
