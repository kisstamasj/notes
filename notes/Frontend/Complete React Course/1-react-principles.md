# React Principles

## 1. Don't touch the DOM. I'll do it.
- **Imperative**: Manipulate the DOM directly.
- **Declarative**: React change the DOM. Give some states wich create VirtualDOM, then react update the DOM.

## 2. Build websites like lego blocks

- Reusable components

## 3. Unidirectional data flow

- **VirtualDOM**: Javascript version of the DOM. Tree like object. Blue print.
- One way data flow in the component tree (top to bottom).
- Easyer to debug the code.

## 4. UI, The rest is up to you
- There is a lots of UI library under React.


## 5. The job of a React developer

- Decide on Components: How to beark down the app to components
- Decide the state and where it lives
- What changes when state changes
